An implementation of the ACER method in R. The ACER (Average Conditional Exceedance Rate) method is used for estimating return levels associated with long return periods. It is an alternative to fitting an extreme value distribution (the GEV and POT methods).

See A. Naess and O. Gaidai: Estimation of extreme values from sampled time series, in Structural Safety 31 (2009) 325--334
